| ------------- | ------------- |
| [Exploratory data analysis](https://github.com/feldmansasha/Data_Science/blob/main/01.%20Analyze.ipynb)  | We need to learn how to determine the market value of real estate. Your task is to set the parameters. This will build an automated system: it will track anomalies and fraudulent activity. |
| [Part1](https://github.com/feldmansasha/Data_Science/blob/main/02.%20Part%201.ipynb)  | Historical data on game sales, user and expert evaluations, genres and platforms (e.g. Xbox or PlayStation) are available from open sources. You need to identify patterns that determine the success of the game. This will allow you to bet on a potentially popular product and plan advertising campaigns.  |
| [Machine Learning 1](https://github.com/feldmansasha/Data_Science/blob/main/03.%20Machine%20Learning.ipynb) | Mobile operator "Megaline" found out: many customers use archive tariffs. They want to build a system that can analyze customer behavior and offer users a new tariff: "Smart" or "Ultra". |
| [Supervized Learning](https://github.com/feldmansasha/Data_Science/blob/main/04.%20Supervized%20learning.ipynb) | "Beta-Bank" started leaving clients. Every month. A little, but noticeable. Banking marketers thought: it is cheaper to save current customers than to attract new ones. It is necessary to predict whether the client will leave the bank in the near future or not. You are provided with historical data on the behavior of clients and the termination of contracts with the bank.|
| [Machine Learning 2](https://github.com/feldmansasha/Data_Science/blob/main/05.%20Machine%20learning.ipynb) | "Beta-Bank" started leaving clients. Every month. A little, but noticeable. Banking marketers thought: it is cheaper to save current customers than to attract new ones. It is necessary to predict whether the client will leave the bank in the near future or not. You are provided with historical data on the behavior of clients and the termination of contracts with the bank.|
| [Part 2](https://github.com/feldmansasha/Data_Science/blob/main/06.%20Part%202.ipynb) | The company develops solutions for efficient operation of industrial enterprises. The model must predict the recovery rate of gold from gold ore. Data with mining and cleaning parameters are at your disposal. The model will help to optimize production so as not to run a plant with loss-making characteristics.|
| [Linear algebra](https://github.com/feldmansasha/Data_Science/blob/main/07.%20Linear%20algebra.ipynb) | You need to protect your customer data from insurance company. Develop a method to convert data so that it is difficult to recover personal information.|
| [Numerical methods](https://github.com/feldmansasha/Data_Science/blob/main/08.%20Numerical%20methods.ipynb) | Car sales service with mileage develops an application to attract new customers. In it you can quickly find out the market value of your car. Historical data: technical specifications, equipment and prices of cars are at your disposal. You need to build a model to determine the price.|
| [Time Series](https://github.com/feldmansasha/Data_Science/blob/main/09.%20Time%20series.ipynb) | Taxi Company has collected historical data on taxi orders at airports. To attract more drivers during the peak load, you need to predict the number of taxi orders for the next hour. Build a model for such a prediction.|
| [ML for texts](https://github.com/feldmansasha/Data_Science/blob/main/10.%20ML%20for%20texts.ipynb) | Teach the model to categorize comments into positive and negative. At your disposal is a data set with markings on the toxicity of edits.l|
| [Final project](https://github.com/feldmansasha/Data_Science/blob/main/11.%20Final%20project.ipynb) | The telecom operator wants to learn how to predict customer outflow. If it turns out that the user is planning to leave, they will be offered promotional codes and special conditions. The operatorâ€™s team collected personal data about some clients, information about their tariffs and contracts.|
